## electron-music-player

Shuffle and play tracks from your local music library.

## Warning!

This project was never meant as anything more than an initial exploration into Electron, and as such has not been maintained.  It is currently broken on the latest version of Electron (v1.1.0 at time of writing).

### Installation

[Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron) must be installed. The easiest way to do this is using [electron-prebuilt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-prebuilt):

```sh
$ npm install -g electron-prebuilt
```

Run the player:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/stephenkubovic/electron-music-player
$ cd electron-music-player
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
